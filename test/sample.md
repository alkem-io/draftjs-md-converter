# Header
## Subheader
Some text below
```
const aCode = 'Block';
```
Then a numbered list:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Followed by a bulleted one:
- Three
- Two
- One

And a couple of paragraphs without "soft" line breaks.

Because "soft" line breaks can't be preserved when converted to DraftJS and back.
